# What next?

In this paper, we presented KickOff, a visual analytics system for analyzing football leagues in a given season. KickOff provides a web-based system organized in two views to support interactive visual analysis of an entire season of the most important football leagues: Italian Serie A, Spanish Primera Division, Franch League One, English Premier League and German Bundesliga.

\par To optimize and improve the system, we plan to add data about more football seasons, allow the possibility to compare teams from minor leagues and add information related to competitions for National Teams. Other possible improvements are to allow the comparison of players based on different (and selectable) attributes and add the possibility to analyze the performance of a player in a single match.

\section{Source Code and Demo}

The source code of KickOff project, included the part of data preprocessing, is available at  \url{\GitHubLoc}.
