# Introduction

The growing impact of big data in the last years affect each task of everyoneâ€™s life.  Even the world of football is radically changed thanks to the use of new technologies and tools that allow being more precise and faster to accomplish some goals.
Football results are strongly related to lots of parameters that often are represented by numeral values, the right analysis of these parameters can be an advantage towards opposing teams. For example, according to research about Italian Serie A, the performance of a team in the entire season are directly related to the number of conceded goals.

In this paper we present **KickOff**, a visual analytic system for evaluating statistics about the world of football. In particular, the system is designed to allow the user to analyze the performance of teams belonging to the most five important championships in Europe: Italian Serie A, English Premier League, Spanish Primera Division, German Bundesliga and French League One. In addition, KickOff allows comparisons of players in these leagues based on their statistics and their impact on the team's results in terms of minutes played and personal total score.

Our main goal is to allow journalists and supporters to obtain information from cross-correlation of data and derived metrics in a simple and fast way, in order to use it for improving working results or just for the statistical matter.
